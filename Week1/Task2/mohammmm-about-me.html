            After graduating from Xavier University with a degree in Computer Science I spent most of my time pursuing a career in Information Systems, one that I have been fortunate to learn about and experience in multiple countries. Yet, a recurring question occupied my mind: Can I call myself academically adept in the field that I work in? This left me longing to deepen my academic knowledge. This was my primary motivation to seek a MS in Information Systems. With the help of University of Cincinnati, I intend to procure the satisfaction I am seeking by exacting my knowledge and augmenting my abilities.

            Based on my research into the Lindner College of Business, it is apparent a different approach to teaching is taken where education is not merely textual but based on real-world applications. My 2.5 years of professional work experience has given me an overall idea of the field of Information Systems; but a graduate degree would allow me to freely explore its boundaries. It would provide an in-depth understanding and illuminate my strengths and weaknesses. The opportunity to work with state-of-the-art facilities and learn from qualified professors will help me realize my potential in the discipline of Information Systems.
